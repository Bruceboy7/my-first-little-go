    <h2>What Does The Theatre Have To Do With Coding?</h2>
      <p>   There really isn't much to be said about the choice of picture above, other than it was the first one found on the desktop of this website's creator. That said, one can derive meaning from most anything. The above picture could either represent the button of the opening number to the hit musical Hamilton, or it could represent a coder's willingness to face the unknown in front of them with the bold tenacity and conviction of a revolutionary. The latter will be what we discuss. </p>
    <h3>Why Must Coders Be Bold</h3>
      <p>   Learning to code is a journey. The road is filled with pitfalls, ominous mountains of information calling out to be understood, joyful release when a program comes together, etc. The more the coder pours themselves into their work, the more change it will affect them on a more varying scale; higher highs and lower lows. That makes sense, right? If someone barely cares about the coding their doing, they're not going to feel the heaviness of an error message after a long day of coding. Likewise, they wont feel the ecstasy of a perfectly running program after grueling edits. Coding, and learning its language, is not for everyone, but can be truly rewarding.</p>
    <h4>Why Code, You Ask?</h4>
      <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/brysontosaurus/">Bryson Bruce</a>, Lafayette pictured above, has a few key benefits to learning to code: 
        <ul>
          <li>You are taught <strong>patience</strong></li>
          <li>Endless opportunites to try and fail and <strong>try again</strong></li>
          <li>Your <strong>wife</strong> will find it very attractive <strong>(job opportunities)</strong></li>
        </ul>
