hello world. 

This is the second (of hopefully many) assignments from the Odin Foundation and its internally linked sites. I made the Directory and the files inside. I copied some code and linked a picture to the HTML code. Boom.

It's just a website with a picture. But I shan't stop there!

Have it saving with Git and am going to experiment with different ideas inside this framework, or at least it is possible to return to this and try out new ideas. 

I also may be busy with future assignments that give the same opportunity..

We shall see.
